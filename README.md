## Description

Welcome to Torontow! This is a simple and straightforward application that allows users to easily create a professional README.md file to accompany their builds by answering a series of project-related questions in the Command Line Interface.

## Installation

Navigate to HERE to find the code for the **Torontow README Generator**. NOTE: This software requires Node.js and Inquirer.js to be installed on your machine in order to function according to the master plan.

## Usage

First, make sure you have the dependent applications installed. 

Next, to run the generator, DO THIS. 

You will be asked a series of questions about your project (description, installation, usage, etc.). When you are satisfied with your input, press ENTER and you will be presented with another question.
*Don't worry--if for any reason you need to edit your answers later, you can.
*Note that you will use arrow keys to choose between the provided License options. A badge four your chosen License will appear beneath the title of your project. You can also edit this selection later.

Once all the questions are answered, a README.md file will be generated and added to your working directory. It will have a Table of Contents which links to all of the sections of your new README.md file, and every section will be filled in with your input! *You can now edit the content of your brand new README.md file as you please.

## Contributing

I did this one all by my lonesome, but I sure learned a lot doing it.

## Tests

I built the appliction using VSCode and used the README Preview feature to make sure everything looked and functioned the way it needed to.
